## When things are similar but aren't equal 

Or when we need to order things, relations are a 
flexible mathematical notion that allows us to compare 
terms or elements. 

The most familiar relation is equality. But you 
have encountered many others at this point: 
- $ \to $ - implication of propositions 
- $ \leq $ - less than (or equality) of numbers
- $ \subseteq $ - subset containment 
- $\mid$ - divisibility

Relations unify all these concepts. We will discuss 
the general concept and then branch off to investigate 
different common properties of relations.
