## The concept underlying (almost) all math

We have seen concepts like propositions, predicates, 
function, and formulas and have seen the value in reasoning 
over them all at once. But how should we make sense of 
collections of propositions? Or of functions? 

There are various ways to approach this but the most common 
is the notion of a _set_. For most mathematicians, the objects 
they work are built up from sets. 

What are sets? We won't answer that question precisely. But, 
we will give you enough examples, properties, and constructions 
that you should gain some intuition for them.
