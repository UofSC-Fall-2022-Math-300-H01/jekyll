## Introduction and elimination for $~\forall$

With a richer language of symbols comes more rules that mimic how we 
argue about truth. Here we extend the rules of inference 
from propositonal logic to include rules for quantifiers and 
equality. 

Introduction and elimination rules model how we either use formulas 
as assumptions or conclude then as goals in arguments.
