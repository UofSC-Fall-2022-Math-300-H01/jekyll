## The workhorses of mathematics 

The basic idea of a function is simple: it takes some 
input and converts it to some output. Its simplicity 
results in robustness of applications. 

We have already seen in Lean how functions are a basic 
ingredient used to represent implication, universal 
quantification, predicates,... 

Due to our familiarity, we will reverse the previous 
order of presentation and discuss functions in Lean 
first. Later we will turn to definition so functions 
in term of sets.
