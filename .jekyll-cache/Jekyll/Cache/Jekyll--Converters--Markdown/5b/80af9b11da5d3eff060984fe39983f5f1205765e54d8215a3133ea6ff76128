<p>Human reason follows some basic patterns.</p>

<p>The truth of one statement is often connected to the 
truth of another statement. For example, let’s take the 
following example.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>. If it is cloudy outside, then I don’t 
need my sunglasses.</p>

<p>To understand the content of this course, the first 
thing we need to do is disentangle our thought a bit. 
There are two closely related but distinct facets of this 
example.</p>

<p>There is the <em>truth</em> of the statement. Is it 
actually cloudy outside or not? Do I actually need sunglasses 
or not? Whether or not someone actually needs their 
sunglasses probably depends on the person and the 
level of cloudiness.</p>

<p>In focusing on the truth of a statement, we care about 
the <em>semantics</em> of the proposition.</p>

<p>Distinctly, we can also view this statement as built up 
from basic “atoms” using well-defined rules.</p>

<p>In our semantic analysis, we already have broken it down into 
two separate statements that can either be truth or 
false in principal:</p>

<p>$A$. It is cloudy outside</p>

<p>$B$. I don’t need my sunglasses</p>

<p>Our example statement is built up from $A$ and $B$ via a 
if-then construction. It then makes sense to denote it 
by $A \Rightarrow B$. The fancy arrow $\Rightarrow$ 
stands in for the if-then.</p>

<p>Thus, <em>symbolically</em> we have $A$ and $B$ and $\Rightarrow$ 
provides a way to connect them to make a new formal symbol
\(A \Rightarrow B\)</p>

<p>Symbolically, $A$ and $B$ have no infused meaning so why do we 
even consider this?</p>

<p><strong>Because symbolic manipulation can be incredibly powerful.</strong> 
It can streamline human thought. It can be mechanized in a 
computer program. It can be converted in a game.</p>

<p>For mathematicians, logical reasoning is especially important. 
When reasoning about intricate structures, it is incredibly easy to 
make a mistake. The history of mathematics is rich with such 
examples.</p>

<p>To help minimize errors, mathematicians grounded their arguments
in logical deduction and fostered a culture of <em>rigorous proofs</em>. 
Let’s look at a more mathematical example.</p>

<p>Recall that
\(\mathbb{N} = \lbrace 0,1,2,\ldots \rbrace\)
is the set of <em>natural numbers</em>. A natural number $n$ is <em>even</em> if 
it can be written as $n = 2m$ for some other natural number $m$. 
A number is <em>odd</em> if is not <em>even</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>. Let $n$ be a natural number. If $n$ is even, then 
$n+1$ is odd. 
t
If we denote</p>

<p>$A$. $n$ is even.</p>

<p>$B$. $n+1$ is odd.</p>

<p>then symbolically we can represent the statement as before 
\(A \Rightarrow B\)
But semantically this if very different than our cloudy/sunglasses 
example above.</p>

<p>We start by introducing the basic structure of logical argument.</p>
