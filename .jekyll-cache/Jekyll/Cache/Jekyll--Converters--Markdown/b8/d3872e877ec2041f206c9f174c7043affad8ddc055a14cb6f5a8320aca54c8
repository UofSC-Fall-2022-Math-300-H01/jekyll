<p>Each day brings greater 
involvement of computers in every facet of our day to day life. Mathematics 
is no different.</p>

<p>Use of computers for computation in mathematics is now very well-established. 
For example, suppose we want to figure out if $2^{15485862}$ is divisible by 
$15485863$. Computing the power and then long dividing by hand would take a 
person awhile. (But there is a secret shortcut if you know some abstract 
algebra). But a well-written computer program can do it in milli-seconds.</p>

<p>Another use, relevant to us directly, is the encoding mathematical ideas and proof 
in computer programs. Proofs become data which the computer can then check for 
correctness.</p>

<p>Mathematicians and computer scientists have worked on this idea for decades but 
it is only relatively recently that computer checked proofs have reached a 
threshold of usability to see widespread adoption by mathematicians.</p>

<p>We will use a tool called <a href="https://leanprover.github.io">Lean</a> to aid us in our 
investigations of mathematics and proof in particular. To begin with, we will 
see how to represent all of proposition logic in Lean.</p>
