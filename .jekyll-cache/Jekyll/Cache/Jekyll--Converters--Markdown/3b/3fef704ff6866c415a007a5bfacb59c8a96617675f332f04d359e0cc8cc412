<p>In a debate or a courtroom, there are usually two opposing sides. One is 
arguing for $A$ and the other is arguing for <em>not</em> $A$.</p>

<p>In propositional logic, we introduce a symbol in the place of not: negation. 
It is denoted by $\neg$.</p>

<p>Given a formula $A$, then we can make a new one $\neg A$. But what should 
be the rules of inference that mimic our arguments involving not? When 
have I established not of a statement? What does knowing the negation of a 
statement allow me to conclude?</p>

<p>One common pattern is to start an argument with $A$ and reason until you 
reach something that is clearly not true. This leads us to also introduce 
a symbol $\bot$ which plays the role of <em>false</em> or “this is crazy”.</p>

<p>Then we can formalize our pattern of argument via the following 
introduction rule for $\neg$</p>

<p>Given an argument assuming $A$ that leads to an absurdity, then we can 
conclude $\neg A$.</p>

<p>To eliminate $\neg$ we have</p>

<p>If both $\neg A$ and $A$ hold, then this is absurd.</p>

<p>What are the rules for introducing and eliminating $\bot$? We actually 
just saw the $\bot$-introduction above – it doubles as the 
$\neg$-elimination rule. The elimination rule is very general.</p>

<p>Once we have established $\bot$, then we are free to reach <strong>any</strong> 
conclusion.</p>

<p>Let’s do another example to see how our rules of deduction interact.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>. Let’s establish 
\(\neg A \land \neg B \to \neg (A \lor B)\)</p>

<p>Recall this is shorthand for $ \vdash (\neg A \land \neg B \to 
\neg(A \lor B))$. In words, this says we can establish 
$ \neg A \land \neg B \to \neg (A \lor B)$ with no assumptions.</p>

<details>
  <summary>
<b>Proof</b>. (Expand to view)
</summary>
  <p>
If we want to establish a conclusion of the form $X \to Y$ then 
we will want to introduce $\to$. To do that we need to provide a 
deduction of the form 
$$
X \vdash Y
$$

In our case, we want to fill in the details for
$$
\neg A \land \neg B \vdash \neg(A \lor B)
$$

Now our goal is of the form $\neg Z$ so we want to introduce $\neg$. 
To do that, we need to supply a proof of $\bot$ from $Z$. 

We have reduced to establishing 
$$
\neg A \land \neg B, A \lor B \vdash \bot
$$

We could combine $A$ and $\neg A$, if we had them, to got $\bot$. The 
same holds for $B$ and $\neg B$. 

ee can eliminate $\neg A \land \neg B$ into either $\neg A$ or $\neg B$. For 
$A \lor B$ elimination, we need proofs of desired conclusion, here 
$\bot$, one with $A$ 
$$
\neg A \land \neg B, A \vdash \bot
$$
and one with $B$ 
$$
\neg A \land \neg B, B \vdash \bot
$$

The proofs of these are quicker.

Putting everything together, we get the following natural deduction proof. 

<center> <img src="/assets/images/png/negation/Natural_deduction_proof.png" title="Natural deduction proof" alt="Natural deduction proof" /> </center>

In step${}^0$, we cancel the assumption $\neg A \land \neg B$ to introduce 
$\to$. In step${}^1$, we cancel the assumption $A \lor B$ to introduce 
$\neg (A \lor B)$ since our conclusion is $\bot$. Finally the steps${}^2$, 
we cancel $A$ and $B$ using or elimination. 

The numerical labels are convenient to keep track of the cancellations. 
Note that all assumptions are cancelled.

<p>Ok so what is the value of this result? It gives a method of proof that holds 
no matter how we interpret $A$ and $B$.</p>

<p>For example, if we say $A$ is “it is hot out” and $B$ is “it is raining”, then 
we can interpret the above as saying “if I know that the either it is not hot 
out or it is not raining, then I can conclude that it is not both hot and sunny”.</p>

<p>Each of formula that we can prove symbolically is an argument pattern that 
can be applied in any context.</p>

<h2 id="some-conventions">Some conventions</h2>

<p>Expressions like $\neg \neg A$ are pretty un-ambiguous and we declare that $\neg$ binds 
most closely. So for example
\(\neg A \to B := (\neg A) \to B \\
\neg C \lor D:= (\neg C) \lor D\)</p>
