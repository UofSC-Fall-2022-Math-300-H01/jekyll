title: Week 15 Announcement
week: 15
date: 2022-12-02

For the last week of classes, make sure 
- to present _at least once_ (this is a quarter of your grade 
completely in your control) and 
- to turn in any revisions by the end of Friday December 2 
(all course materials can be found at our GitHub org) 

Each presentation after the first will convert your lowest 
homework or quiz to a 100%. 

I've sent out an assignment in Teams that just serves to 
report your current grade.
